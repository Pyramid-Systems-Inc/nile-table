# Project: "The Nile's Table" - Interactive Restaurant & Booking System

## 1. Project Vision & Goal

*   **Vision:** To create a digital flagship for a fictional, upscale Egyptian restaurant. The website will not be a simple brochure; it will be an immersive experience that reflects the quality of the restaurant itself, driving customer engagement and directly increasing reservations through a seamless, integrated booking system.
*   **Primary Goal:** To build a portfolio piece that demonstrates full-stack capability (front-end, back-end, database) and a deep understanding of a client's business needs. This project will serve as a direct demonstration of a product you can build for any restaurant, cafe, or hospitality business.

## 2. Core Modules & Pillars

*   The project is broken down into three main interconnected parts:
    1.  **The Public-Facing Website (The Showcase):** The beautiful, interactive website that customers will see.
    2.  **The Booking Engine (The Logic):** The system that handles reservation logic, availability, and user input.
    3.  **The Admin Dashboard (The Control Panel):** The password-protected area where the "restaurant owner" manages everything.

## 3. The "Pharaoh's" Branding & Design Concept

*   **Name:** The Nile's Table
*   **Aesthetic:** Modern luxury meets ancient heritage. Clean lines, elegant typography, and a rich color palette.
*   **Color Palette:** Deep navy blue, gold, sandy beige, and white.
*   **Imagery:** Professional, high-contrast photography of food and minimalist shots of the restaurant interior (you can find high-quality stock photos for this). Subtle uses of papyrus textures or hieroglyphic patterns in borders or backgrounds.
*   **Logo:** A minimalist logo combining a lotus flower and a dinner plate.

## 4. Technology Stack (Demonstrates Modern Expertise)

*   **Frontend:** **Next.js (React Framework)**. chosen for its excellent performance, SEO benefits (crucial for a real business), and great developer experience.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**. For rapid, modern, and responsive UI development.
*   **Animations:** **Framer Motion**. To add subtle, elegant animations that enhance the luxury feel.
*   **Backend:** **Supabase** or **Node.js with Express**.
    *   **Recommendation: Supabase.** It's a "Backend as a Service" that gives you a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and instant APIs. It's perfect for this project and shows you can work with modern, efficient tools.
*   **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (comes with Supabase).
*   **Email Service:** **Resend** or **SendGrid**. For sending transactional booking confirmation emails.
*   **Deployment:** **Vercel** for the front-end and **Supabase** for the backend/database.
## 5. Current Project Status

**Last Updated: June 14, 2025**

*   **Phase 1: The Foundation - COMPLETED**
    *   The initial setup of the Next.js application, integration with Supabase, the core database schema, a basic (unstyled) public booking form, and a rudimentary admin area to view bookings are all complete. The end-to-end booking flow is functional.
    *   The project is now proceeding to **Phase 2: The Polished Product**.
